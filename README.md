# Graph Tool

## Installation

### Prerequisites
This app requies the [node-sqlite3 module](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3). To install, open up command prompt/terminal and `cd` to your cloned directory. Run the following command to install it:

    npm install sqlite3
	
## Using the tool

With command prompt/terminal open to the cloned directory, run:

    node main.js
	
Drop in your `StableTytoDome.db` file into the directory, then, open up your browser to `localhost:1337`. Currently, this will only work for the file named "StableTytoDome.db", so you'll need to overwrite that file with new databases.
